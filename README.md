# Naurandirs Example for Angular + Spring Boot + Keycloak
An example how to setup angular and spring boot together with keycloak

## Version
* Angular: 17.3.4
* Spring-Boot: 3.2.4
* Keycloak: 24.0.3

## Notice
* I used bootstrap for a nicer top menu to make also the simple example more appealing
* Note that for showing purpose the Admin Menu Entry also has a bit error handling added
* In order to allow a user with the login flow to work in the angular app the role "view-profile" is minimum that needs to be allowed on a user
